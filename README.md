# Handcricket-on-Python
I created a simple handcricket game on python through a function.
In this game, you are playing against the computer.
You can score between 1 to 6, the computer's job is to get you out.
You get out only when your input matches the computer's input.
Until you get out, you keep scoring and your total score is the sum of all your past inputs.
